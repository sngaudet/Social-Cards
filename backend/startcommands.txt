If you want to test nearby users fast with 1 phone:

create fake users/<fakeUid> docs in Firestore
create matching presence/<fakeUid> docs near your lat/lng
then open nearby screen and verify they show up
Required fake user fields:

firstName, major, hobbies, photoURL, iceBreakerOne, iceBreakerTwo, iceBreakerThree
Required fake presence fields:

uid, lat, lng, geohash, accuracyM, source, updatedAt, expiresAt
If you want, I can give you exact copy/paste fake docs (with realistic lat/lng offsets) for instant nearby and crowd testing.
